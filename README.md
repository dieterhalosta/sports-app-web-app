# Sports App - Web App
A simple app to create and book a sports event from a catalog of events.

# Inspiration
I wanted to consolidate the principles that I learned during my Java Bootcamp and this is also my certification project.
So I created the front end for this app using Bootstrap and jQuery.

# Development stack
+ [JavaScript]
+ [Bootstrap] for the features and easy to use templates.
+ [Neumorphism UI] as a templates.
+ I used [jQuery] to connect with the back end.
+ I used git for version control, and stored progress on GitHub.
+ Currently only tested on an Windows enviorment.
